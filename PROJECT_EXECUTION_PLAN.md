## Development Environment
- Node.js environment
- React + TypeScript
- Vite for development and building
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI for styling
- GitHub for version control

## Testing Data
Development data is now loaded from actual CSV files in example-data:
- Market Prices: example-data/market-prices.csv
- Transactions: example-data/transactions.csv
- Fallback to hardcoded data if file loading fails

## Dependencies
- React + TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI
- React Router
- date-fns
- Papa Parse
- Recharts

## Notes for Next Developer
1. The development data system now uses real CSV files from example-data directory
2. Portfolio calculations have been improved and tested with real data
3. UI components use Radix UI Theme - ensure proper theme provider setup
4. Transaction type mapping has been enhanced - check csvService.ts for fundCodeMap
5. Market price matching logic has been improved - see portfolioService.ts
6. Component styling uses both Tailwind and Radix UI - check index.css for custom styles
7. Transaction History filters use "ALL" value instead of empty strings
8. Date formatting uses UK format (DD/MM/YYYY)
9. Amounts are properly signed based on transaction type
10. Charts in Analysis view use Recharts with proper formatting

## Known Issues to Address
1. React Router future flag warnings need to be addressed
2. Some transactions still show "No matching market price" warnings
3. Performance calculations could be improved
4. Date range filters need better validation
